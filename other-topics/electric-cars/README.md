# Talking points
- Owning & driving an electric car (vs. ICE car)
- Charging
    - Basics
    - Infrastructure
- Some good tips & tricks
- Questions?

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer
This talk focuses on the current state as of November 2020 in Germany.

Some of the points might not be applicable anymore or in other countries.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Opinions ahead!** (_duh!_)

**Renault Zo√© R110 Z.E.50 (2020)**
_also called "Renault Zo√© Phase II"_
100 kW / 135 bhp / 52 kWh net
395 km WLTP / √∏ 17.2 kWh/100km

# Owning an electric car
## My situation
- no garage
- no carport
- no private driveway
- = no private charging port
  üá©üá™ _"Laternenparker"_

But:
- ‚òëÔ∏è can charge at work (commute: < 10km)
- ‚òëÔ∏è next public charging station: üö∂ < 15min
- ‚òëÔ∏è supermarket with (free!) charging station in range

---

# Driving an electric car
- drives like an _Automatic_ except:
    - no gear changes (because _no gears_)
    - ü§´ silent*
    - quick acceleration
    - breaking _recharges_ your battery! üîã‚ö°Ô∏è
      _recuperation_ / üá©üá™ _Rekuperation_
    - highly efficient in city environments
      _very low energy consumption_
    - zero CO2 emissions
    - cheaper in upkeep (e.g. no oil, coolant, exhaust, etc. to maintain)

---

# Driving an electric car
## üòï The Negatives
- less range than ICE cars
- longer "fuel stops"
- charging is not always as straight forward as refueling (see _Infrastructure_)

_These points are very car-dependant._

‚ö†Ô∏è Driving an electric car requires you to **unlearn some habits** and **relearn** some new ones.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Charging
## How do I even charge this thing?

---

# First: **Plugs & Sockets**
- Type 2
- CCS
- CHAdeMO
- CEE
- Household socket

---

# Type 2
![bg right contain](./images/type2.png)
- found almost everywhere
- found on almost every car
- can charge up to **22kW AC** (sometimes 43kW AC)
- commonly provided by city charging points

This is also called the _Mennekes_ plug.

---

# CCS
![bg right contain](./images/ccs.png)
- found at high-speed / fast chargers (e.g. at highway rest stops)
- not all cars have it (but most these days do)
- can charge up to **300kW DC**

These are your friend on long-distance trips!

---

# CHAdeMO
![bg right contain](./images/chademo.png)

- developed in Japan
- found on older electric cars
- can charge up to **50kW DC**

This plug is starting to be replaced in favour of Type 2.

---

# CEE
![bg right contain](./images/cee.png)

- "camper plug" / "industrial plug"
- only with adapters / mobile charging boxes
- only delivers:
    - _blue_: **3.7kW AC** (230V, 16A)
    - _red_: **11kW AC** (400V, 26A)

_If you upgrade your garage, you should get this and a supported wallbox._

---

# Household sockets (i.e. Schuko)
![bg right contain](./images/schuko.png)

- "it delivers energy..."
- recommended: up to **2.3kW AC** (230V, 10A)
- if equipped: up to **3.7kW AC** (230V, 16A)

_If you have it in your garage, you can use it to keep your car charged up._

---

# Next: **Charging power**

Know your cars limits

Example: _Renault Zo√©_
- Type 2: up to **43kW**
- CCS: up to **50kW**

A CCS hyper-charger with up to 300kW DC won't charge your car faster, if you can only draw 50kW.

---

# And finally: **Charging curves**

**Cars won't charge with full power all the time**!
This would shorten the life span of the battery.

**Charging speeds usually drop off after reaching _~80% SoC_.**
Check the internet or test yourself. This can be good information to know for long-distance trips.

**Pro tip for long-distance trips: _Never charge to 100% SoC._**
Charging the last 20% can take about as long as the first 60-80%. Waiting for 100% usually _wastes time_.

Also: Don't wait too long before charging up. This could bite you.
